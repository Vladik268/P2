	"bm_suit_var_jumpsuit_purpol_desc": "At around the end of October, the PAYDAY Gang received a tip about a lucrative opportunity to rob a meth lab. As Bain fumbled around with his pen and paper searching for a plan, Dallas had an idea. With a twinkle in his eye he commanded, 'Shut the fuck up.' He continued, 'I have a plan that's worked before, and it's gonna work again'. It turns out, the meth lab had a bit of a tarantula infestation. However, there wasn't a bug problem that Bodhi's Pest Control couldn't fix. At precisely 9:30 PM, the gang entered the house in full uniform. The nice owner of the house led them to the lab. The four clowns were shocked at what stood before them. Unfortunately, the plan went sour when Wolf opened fire on a tarantula perched on the side of the table. He still insists it got away."

	"bm_suit_var_jumpsuit_dark": "One-Forty-Fiver",
	"bm_suit_var_jumpsuit_dark_desc": "OVERKILL. That's what the numbers one-four-five represent. They describe a heister so stone cold, that one might think they have a deathwish. Let it be known; heisters who don this outfit truly have a criminal's ambition."

	"bm_suit_var_jumpsuit_hox": "Hazelton Hellraiser",
	"bm_suit_var_jumpsuit_hox_desc": "Up to this point, Hoxton had endured bleach poured in his eyes, a near fatal amount of toothbrush stab wounds, and more beatings from the prison guards than Hoxton himself inflicted on Matt Roscoe. Usually he would feel miserable, but he had recently received a bit of info that brought him right back to the good old days. As he sat in his cell and put the finishing touches on his new mask, he smirked and wondered how his old crew could even think about replacing him."

	"bm_suit_var_jumpsuit_hazmat": "Hazmat Heister",
	"bm_suit_var_jumpsuit_hazmat_desc": "The hazmat suit has all kinds of uses: handling radioactive materials, disposing human waste, inspecting alien artifacts, the usual. Bain has had these in storage for a while just in case anything hazmat-worthy comes up. Hopefully, that never happens."

	"bm_suit_var_jumpsuit_dollar": "Dollar Bills",
	"bm_suit_var_jumpsuit_dollar_desc": "Jimmy claims that wearing this will help one stay camouflaged when emptying out bank vaults, but no one wants to put his theory up to the test."

	"bm_suit_var_jumpsuit_pink": "Ignition",
	"bm_suit_var_jumpsuit_pink_desc": "A crew out of Denver years back ran with pink attire -- apparently, in the leader's words, it 'blended nicely with the blood.' \n\They're a local legend in those parts, infamous for crashing parties for the rich and raiding banks, and their brand of bombastic pink is sure to make anyone familiar with their escapades reach for the sky."

	"bm_suit_var_miami_shun": "Millenium Crimson",
	"bm_suit_var_miami_shun_desc": "To pull off an outfit like this, you need to have status, and a lot of cash. As a member of the PAYDAY gang, both are easily obtainable. Heisters that are this fashionable are sure to make it rain."

	"bm_suit_var_miami_dust": "Dust Drifter",
	"bm_suit_var_miami_dust_desc": "Sometimes, you just gotta unwind. You might catch a man named Nathan Steele down at the bar wearing this after an exhausting bank withdrawal. Nobody knows a lot about him, except that he has a bad smoking habit. But one thing's for certain; he's gone drifting."

	"bm_suit_var_miami_ocean": "Ocean Breeze",
	"bm_suit_var_miami_ocean_desc": "Wearing this outfit means that you know how to keep a cool head in dangerous situations and go with the flow. In the middle of bulldozers screaming, Cloakers charging, and drills jamming, all you could do is close your eyes and listen to the ocean."

	"bm_suit_var_miami_inv": "Greyscale",
	"bm_suit_var_miami_inv_desc": "A great choice for those who want to be intimidating, discreet, and professional, all at the same time. Often spotted carrying suspicious briefcases and speaking into an earpiece. As far as anyone else is concerned, you never existed."

	"bm_suit_var_miami_writer": "The Writer",
	"bm_suit_var_miami_writer_desc": "Evan Wright, former war journalist. These days, a naive writer who's found himself knee deep in something far beyond his comprehension. He stared at the motionless mobster he had brutalized moments before. 'Somebody, call an ambulance! There's been an accident!' he cried helplessly. No answer. He stepped over the lifeless corpse and burst through the front door, only to find some unexpected guests armed with baseball bats and fully-automatic machine guns. The Writer knew there was only one way he would get the answers he desired..."

	"bm_suit_var_miami_rat": "The Rat",
	"bm_suit_var_miami_rat_desc": "Richter Berg, a tough guy who takes orders from no one, until now. When he received a strange call from an intimidating individual, he knew he didn't have much of a choice. Much like another masked maniac, Richter obediently followed the mysterious caller's murderous demands with deadly efficiency."

	"bm_suit_var_miami_gang": "The Gangster",
	"bm_suit_var_miami_gang_desc": "The remnants of an old group of mobsters who were wiped out by a particularly ruthless detective. They couldn't hit the broad side of a barn if their life depended on it, but they knew how to dress with style. It took days to clean the blood stains from this outfit."

	"bm_suit_var_miami_legend": "Essence of Fashion",
	"bm_suit_var_miami_legend_desc": "A suit that represents a man who prefers to solve situations with his fists, but is also a softie at heart. A legendary karaoke king who always seems to be pulled into problems that aren't his own."

	"bm_suit_var_miami_detective": "The Detective",
	"bm_suit_var_miami_detective_desc": "Manny Pardo, the lead detective on the frightening case of the Miami Mutilator. A bit of a controversial figure, with rumors floating around about his questionable methods. Regardless, he gets the job done, albeit crossing multiple lines of red tape. Despite the detective's debatable moral standing, one thing's for certain; he was born with thick skin. "

	"bm_suit_var_clown_noir": "D.C. Noire",
	"bm_suit_var_clown_noir_desc": "Lieutenant Garrett surveyed the scene of yet another break-in. Every single valuable item was plucked clean from the jewelry store. As usual, no finger prints were found, and the camera footage was unusable. This wasn't the first time, and it certainly wouldn't be the last. The grudge-bearing lieutenant knew that someday, he would be the one to put the culprits behind bars."

	"bm_suit_var_clown_charcoal": "The Night",
	"bm_suit_var_clown_charcoal_desc": "Years ago, there were rumors of some psycho vigilante beating the living crap out of various criminals. Kept saying something about 'vengeance' and being scared of bats. Nobody's really sure how, but he really kept the streets of D.C. relatively clean for a while, until the PAYDAY gang came along. Houston still likes to brag about the day he scared off the 'Bat-Fiend' just by pelting him with money bundles."

	"bm_suit_var_clown_winters": "Cold Winters",
	"bm_suit_var_clown_winters_desc": "Neville Winters was dumbfounded that it's taken D.C. since 2011 to arrest a group of circus performers. The future captain had no idea what he was in for."

	"bm_suit_var_clown_cloud": "Special Occasion",
	"bm_suit_var_clown_cloud_desc": "When the PAYDAY gang is hitting more classy establishments, they like to break out the three-piece suits instead of the typical two-piece. It's not very comfortable, but who cares about comfort when you look this fancy? This is Chains' three-piece, only for special occasions."

	"bm_suit_var_clown_enigma": "The Puzzler",
	"bm_suit_var_clown_enigma_desc": "The most puzzling thing about this individual is his tendency to leave clues behind at every one of his crime scenes. A watch here, a monkey statue there, and even some playing cards across the floor, accompanied by the message: \n\ \n\'Can you solve my riddle?' \n\ \n\The police analyzed the finger prints and found him in less than 24 hours."

	"bm_suit_var_peacoat_ladybug": "Snake Eyes",
	"bm_suit_var_peacoat_ladybug_desc": "Bonnie's gambling addiction led her to an underground casino in one of the shadier parts of DC. After ordering a few drinks, she participated in a game of Texas Hold-em that turned out to be completely rigged against her favor. Naturally, Bonnie walked out of the casino five minutes later with a fancy new suit and a hefty bundle of cash. When the police later investigated the crime scene, the one detail that stuck out to them the most was the fact that all the victims died from blunt force trauma, despite each of them having a gun."

	"bm_suit_var_peacoat_grass": "Greenback",
	"bm_suit_var_peacoat_grass_desc": "Contrary to popular belief, the PAYDAY gang does not only heist for the sheer thrill of it, but also out of necessity. First of all, the safehouse's rent is absolutely through the roof. Keeping the lights on in that place isn't free. Plus, who's gonna pay for Wolf's hardware? Sydney's art supplies? Jacket's tape recorders? It doesn't help that the money is constantly being gambled away or spent on cigarettes. And of course, there's twenty-two mouths to feed. On top of all of this, Bain gets suspiciously quiet when asked about the whereabouts of the gang's offshore cash."

	"bm_suit_var_peacoat_purple": "Practical Purple",
	"bm_suit_var_peacoat_purple_desc": "Unlike Vlad, Jimmy's party attire is at least passable. Jimmy could often be found lying motionlessly on the floor wearing this very peacoat. For your own safety, do not try to wake him up."

	"bm_suit_var_peacoat_sky": "Breaking Point",
	"bm_suit_var_peacoat_sky_desc": "Houston's life was in shambles. No education, no job, and no one he could trust. Of course, he was hundreds- no, THOUSANDS in debt from slimy loan sharks. He knew he couldn't go on like this much longer, but he didn't have much of a choice. As Houston dialed the loan company's phone number to beg for yet another deadline extension, he received a curious text message from an older brother he hadn't spoken to in years..."

	"bm_suit_var_peacoat_vlad": "Uninvited Guest",
	"bm_suit_var_peacoat_vlad_desc": "Parties hosted at the gang's safehouse have only one strict rule: don't tell Vlad. Of course, the truth can slip through occasionally, and Vlad will decide to invite himself anyway, much to the dismay of everyone else. He drinks enough to make even Duke recoil in disgust, and his awful dancing skills make Wolf's violent swinging on the dance floor look good. And of course, Vlad always has a way of digging up quite possibly the gaudiest outfits known to man. Hopefully, he won't notice this one's missing."

	"bm_suit_var_continental_default": "The Anniversary",
	"bm_suit_var_continental_default_desc": "The original suit Hoxton stole in a panic to hide from the heat, and miraculously succeeded. With its distinct gold accents, this getup barely walks the line between classy and gaudy. But that's nothing new for the PAYDAY gang."

	"bm_suit_var_continental_dallas": "The Mastermind",
	"bm_suit_var_continental_dallas_desc": "As second-in-command to the PAYDAY gang, Dallas can afford to treat himself to a fancy new suit every so often. With its intricately woven vicuña yarn, this suit is easily worth more than one individual could make in their lifetime. Speaking of lifetime, it's rumored that one crew member in training may have had theirs cut short for spilling their drink on it during a party."

	"bm_suit_var_continental_assassin": "The Hitman",
	"bm_suit_var_continental_assassin_desc": "Dragan and Wick like to hang around in the safehouse living room and reminiscence from time to time. During one fateful session, Dragan could not believe what he was hearing. 'Really, John? You killed those guys with a pencil?' Wick shrugged. 'I guess they got the point, right, Dragan?' This awful, irredeemable pun caused a rift in their friendship that spanned several months."

	"bm_suit_var_continental_rose": "The Flamingo",
	"bm_suit_var_continental_rose_desc": "Another PAYDAY gang member who didn't make the cut. They were a little too obsessed with dressing as flashy and stylish as possible. Unfortunately, they made the mistake of commenting on Jacket's unconventional heisting attire, and Locke had to do the dirty work of making sure this former criminal could seek asylum somewhere Jacket wouldn't find them."

	"bm_suit_var_continental_sokol": "The Grinder",
	"bm_suit_var_continental_sokol_desc": "Sokol wonders how the hell he became the 'hockey guy' of the crew. Did everyone just forget he engineered the BFD? Whenever the safehouse power goes out, Wolf is usually too busy figuring out ways to make the drills jam more often, so it's usually Sokol's (thankless) job to deal with it. Oh well, at least he has the highest score on the hockey machine."

	"bm_suit_var_continental_houston": "The Ghost",
	"bm_suit_var_continental_houston_desc": "Houston, formerly known as Hoxton, had some important shoes to fill. He was disappointed to find out that his role in the gang was a little quieter than he had hoped. His brother Nathan sold him on the idea of going on adrenaline pumping heists with guns blazing, but here he was, screwing a suppressor onto his Chimano 88. At least it's better than his old life, he rationalized to himself."

	"bm_suit_var_continental_enforcer": "The Enforcer",
	"bm_suit_var_continental_enforcer_desc": "The PAYDAY gang's favorite pastime was robbing the Harvest & Trustee Bank for what could plausibly be the millionth time. The payoff usually wasn't that great and the ceiling was lined with asbestos, but it was the easiest way to get some pocket change for lunch afterward. That was until Chains stumbled upon his three crewmates wounded on the pavement at the feet of a new, powerful foe, marked with an intimidating skull on his mask. The two KSP wielding titans faced each other for a moment, and knew only one of them would get out of this one alive..."

	"bm_suit_var_continental_hox": "The Fugitive",
	"bm_suit_var_continental_hox_desc": "The crew would not stop laughing at Hoxton's new Anniversary suit. Even Houston joined in and called him a 'fucking checkerboard'. Hoxton eventually caved in and agreed that he could use some less garish clothing. After stealing Houston's credit card, Hoxton went and got himself this fashionable new outfit."

	"bm_suit_var_continental_wolf": "The Technician",
	"bm_suit_var_continental_wolf_desc": "Wolf felt a little bit left out when the rest of the gang got new threads and he didn't. So like any sane, reasonable person would, he went out and splurged on one. He even went out for ice cream afterward! \n\ \n\Anyway, he wedged a thermal drill between a Bulldozer's eyes the morning after."

	"bm_suit_var_continental_dragan": "The Infiltrator",
	"bm_suit_var_continental_dragan_desc": "Dragan could not believe that Wick would tell him such an awful pencil pun. Frequently he would step outside the safehouse to vent to The Butcher about his shattered friendship with Wick. After The Butcher reminded Dragan about the time he asked the pager operator 'what does the fox say' Dragan promptly went to apologize to Wick."

	"bm_suit_var_continental_wildcard": "The Wildcard",
	"bm_suit_var_continental_wildcard_desc": "A suit that was worn by a heister who was too much of a prankster for their own good. After purposefully spilling their drink on Dallas' one-of-a-kind suit during their crew member initiation party, they disappeared. Maybe you can carry their legacy."

	"bm_suit_var_continental_conman": "The Con Artist",
	"bm_suit_var_continental_conman_desc": "A ladies' man with a silver tongue and a knack for causing trouble. This felon has had his fair share of run-ins with the law. Commonly found stealing money from people who were gullible enough to trust him. \n\ \n\A mysterious call from a man called 'Bain' encouraged this drifter to rethink his whole strategy."

	"bm_suit_var_continental_duke": "The Stoic",
	"bm_suit_var_continental_duke_desc": "Duke already knows damn well how to dress, and he wouldn't be caught dead wearing anything less than a fortune, but another expensive suit never hurt anyone."

	"bm_suit_var_continental_negative": "The Negative",
	"bm_suit_var_continental_negative_desc": "It's hard to stay positive in one hundred degree weather wearing a two-piece suit, a full suit of armor, two weapons, a money bag, and a doctor bag all at once, all while being shot at from all directions. Thankfully, Dallas is always there to encourage the rest of the team to pick up the pace and keep things moving when Bain gets up from the computer to microwave another TV dinner."

	"bm_suit_var_continental_chicken": "The Sociopath",
	"bm_suit_var_continental_chicken_desc": "About a month after the gang had their expensive suit shopping spree, Jacket was seen around the safehouse wearing this unique attire, playing and rewinding pickup lines and Bond quotes on his tape recorder. He may not have the fashion sense, but he certainly has the spirit. It wouldn't be a smart idea to criticize his outfit of choice anyway."

	"bm_suit_var_gentleman_smokin": "Cuban Pete",
	"bm_suit_var_gentleman_smokin_desc": "It's PAYDAY time! \n\P-A-Y-D-A... Y?  \n\Because I gotta!"

	"bm_suit_var_gentleman_vengeance": "Red Revengeance",
	"bm_suit_var_gentleman_vengeance_desc": "An outlaw once said revenge is a fool's errand, but when your old train robbing gang betrays you and leaves you on your own, what's a gunslinger to do?"

	"bm_suit_var_gentleman_board": "Private Eye",

	"bm_suit_var_gentleman_raspberry_desc": "Some may say that the rose is a symbol of love, a gift meant for someone special. To you, it's a calling card."

	"bm_suit_var_punk_revolution": "Shot Through The Heart",
	"bm_suit_var_punk_revolution_desc": "You didn't read it here, but rumor has it that Houston is actually a huge Bon Jovi fan. The rest of the gang hears his awful singing from the other room on a weekly basis, but nobody has the heart to tell him that. Duke thought about breaking the news to Houston for a while, but ultimately decided it wasn't worth the risk of exposing someone who could pick any lock he wanted. As of writing this, Houston's most played song on his Pear playlist is 'It's My Life'."

	"bm_suit_var_punk_carrot": "Carrot Orange",
	"bm_suit_var_punk_carrot_desc": "Remember to eat your veggies, or it won't be a Cloaker that'll be kicking your ass, it'll be a combination of your poor eyesight from a lack of carrot consumption and poor life choices."

	"bm_suit_var_punk_pink": "Night Runner",
	"bm_suit_var_punk_pink_desc": "Chase down what you seek, no matter the danger. Get knocked down? Get back up, and lick those wounds. Burn the night with bold color."

	"bm_suit_var_punk_green": "Green Apple",
	"bm_suit_var_punk_green_desc": "Someone keeps adding Green Day to the safehouse Pear playlist. None of the crew can stand it, and it's a mystery who listens to Green Day in their free time. There's been fingers pointed at Sydney, Hoxton, Joy, and the other usual suspects, but nobody has admitted to their sins yet. Duke continues to complain about whatever's playing on the speakers regardless, and tries to drown it out with orchestra music on his record player. Everyone makes fun of him."

	"bm_suit_var_punk_queen": "Queen of Hearts",
	"bm_suit_var_punk_queen_desc": "Dragan is always the one to sing 'of the world' at the end of 'We are the Champions', even though it wasn't there in the first place. Wick thinks it ruins the song, but Dragan loves the attention it gets him."

	"bm_suit_var_punk_sky": "Mister Blue Sky",
	"bm_suit_var_punk_sky_desc": "Bile likes to turn on classic pop music in his helicopter during particularly risky heists. There's nothing like some classic tunes to keep him focused in the midst of 5.56 ricocheting off his propellers."

	"bm_suit_var_punk_violet": "Void Beast",
	"bm_suit_var_punk_violet_desc": "Nobody is sure where natural purple leather came from.  Perhaps genetic testing for the sake of new fashion materials?  Or some expensive dye process?

No matter, sport those colors.  Be the beast it belongs to."

	"bm_suit_var_hiphop_lake": "Laundromat Blues",
	"bm_suit_var_hiphop_lake_desc": "This comfy outfit belonging to Jiro used to be white, but unfortunately, Jiro trusted his laundry with the wrong crew member. Sydney is no longer allowed to run the safehouse washing machine."

	"bm_suit_var_hiphop_flavor": "Flavorville",
	"bm_suit_var_hiphop_flavor_desc": "Dragan's obnoxious Fry Pieri phase came to an abrupt and tragic end when he shattered the safehouse bathroom scale. He's taken up weight-lifting ever since. This ancient shirt was found shoved behind several sets of identical burgundy suits."

	"bm_suit_var_hiphop_purple": "Royal Purple",
	"bm_suit_var_hiphop_purple_desc": "Purple has been viewed historically as a symbol of wealth and power. Thankfully, the PAYDAY crew has both of these, and they're not afraid to show it off. This is a far more comfy solution versus an expensive three piece suit."

	"bm_suit_var_hiphop_orange": "Nacho Cheese",
	"bm_suit_var_hiphop_orange_desc": "Aldstone fantasizes about the day he finally catches the dastardly son of a bitch who's been getting cheese dust all over the safehouse furniture."

	"bm_suit_var_slaughterhouse_yellow_desc": "Whenever the occasional wasp or killer bee makes its way into the safehouse, Jacket is usually the one the gang summons to handle it. Rather than outright killing it, Jacket simply picks it up, lets it crawl around on his hand for a while so he can inspect it, and lets it free outside. Whether this is a case of superior resolve or a lack of fear altogether is up in the air."

I mean, the leader of the Dingos gang changed about every week or so due to the previous leader either being arrested or shot because of some stupid plan that was never going to work. The PAYDAY gang is cool, professional, and honestly, quite terrifying. Sydney can't quite figure out whether she admires or fears Wolf, and even Sydney at her worst is nothing compared to Jacket's fury.

Extremely laidback with friends, but violent with enemies, he quickly earned his reputation in the cartel by kidnapping rich, influential figures in the area and forcing them onto Buluc's side. This was dirty work for him that he took no pleasure in doing. Through the smiles and laughter he frequently shares with Buluc, he wishes he could punch his lights out the first chance he gets."

Hajrudin was very excited to go to Mexico to see his old friend again. Conveniently, he resided in the city of Tijuana, so Hajrudin headed there immediately after the San Martín job. Mike met Hajrudin with a party full of expensive drinks. After a night of drinking, Hajrudin woke up in a cold, grey interrogation room surrounded by Federales. This was the easiest of Mike's jobs, although he was bummed that Buluc made him betray an old friend like that. He wondered how difficult it'd be to betray Buluc..."

They strolled out of Buluc's office, ready to finish off the rest of Buluc's guards, but to their surprise, the gang found the survivors cheering!

Sometimes Antonio could hardly walk from the injuries Buluc would inflict on him for seemingly no reason. But Antonio has had enough. Turns out, he's been feeding the shark some pieces of meat wrapped in Buluc's dirty laundry to get it more accustomed to Buluc. He's been waiting for the perfect 'accident' for Buluc to trip and fall into the tank. He's not saying he'd murder Buluc, but he wouldn't stop some shady business if he saw it happening."

Some say he could fly. Others say that he's turned human beings into ashes just by looking at them. The locals say that he made it rain tequila by snapping his fingers. He has never shown his face nor spoken a word in anyone's presence.

	"bm_suit_var_highinttech_green_desc": "These fearsome figures are the might and fury of the Golden Dagger Triad.

	"bm_suit_var_highinttech_brown": "Ripstop Tactical Monk",
	"bm_suit_var_highinttech_brown_desc": "One of the more curious parts of the Golden Dagger Triad is their appreciation of spiritual life.

	"bm_suit_var_highinttech_pink": "Ripstop Tactical Warrior",
	"bm_suit_var_highinttech_pink_desc": "This one wields dual Uzis and screams at his enemies with a horrible accent. His fellow members are pretty sure he isn't even Chinese, but no one dares to ask him. Legends say he's got a tactical nuke somewhere in his arsenal."

	"bm_suit_var_highinttech_actuallygreen_desc": "Jiu Feng has made plenty of people disappear in his profession, but this new contract caught him off guard. Apparently, his partner-in-crime Joy is suspected of hacking into the Golden Dagger Triad's network and is now to be eliminated, despite serving them well in the past. To their luck, Joy received a call from a shadowy figure named Locke. Apparently, the legendary gang from DC was in dire need of someone who knows their way around a computer. This was the perfect ticket out... but now they're being pulled right back in."


	"bm_suit_var_lowinttech_yellow": "Ripstop Casual Surgeon",
	"bm_suit_var_lowinttech_yellow_desc": "A dark, mysterious figure with even more dark and mysterious healing methods.

Go to a hospital with a bullet wound?"

	"bm_suit_var_lowinttech_pink": "Ripstop Casual Artist",
	"bm_suit_var_lowinttech_pink_desc": "Paying an artist is actually quite a huge part of the Golden Dagger Triad's budget. Those sick tattoos aren't going to draw themselves, you know?

	"bm_suit_var_lowinttech_purple_desc": "The Golden Dagger Triad has lots of force, but with only dumb muscle, it would be powerless. This gentleman can easily distinguish between a genuine priceless artifact and a fake at a single glance. If the stuff has any value, it is sent to the boss to serve as a decoration. The duds go off to be auctioneered at the Tea Shop to wealthy San Francisco fools."

	"bm_suit_var_lowinttech_red": "Ripstop Casual Engineer",
	"bm_suit_var_lowinttech_red_desc": "A dangerous genius. He eliminated Pear out of San Francisco by making cheap knockoffs of their products. His products were prone to spontaneous explosions, but that just means the customers are going to buy a replacement, resulting in even more sales!\n\ \n\Or so he thought. Things took a turn when one of his own products exploded in his pocket, resulting in a chain reaction of his entire store bursting into flames."

	"bm_suit_var_hippie_album": "White Album",
	"bm_suit_var_hippie_album_desc": "Every band eventually has their own 'white album'. After an evening of hitting the sauce and smoking grass, they decide to get experimental and cook up quite possibly some of the worst songs you have ever heard in your entire life. However, they also cook up some of the most unique and interesting songs in their career. In a way, the PAYDAY gang is in their own perpetual white album. Sometimes, they get to enjoy the Benevolent bank.\n\ \n\Other times, they get to rescue goats."

	"bm_suit_var_hippie_purple_desc": "The honest, more disturbing reason Hoxton burned down the old safehouse is because he claims that when he kicked down the doors of the locked rooms of the laundromat, he saw what could only be described as large, red text standing over a purple and black checkerboard. Upon seeing this horrific, otherworldly sight, Hoxton decided it was time to move out. The rest of the gang thinks prison messed him up in more ways than one, but Hoxton sticks to his story."

	"bm_suit_var_general_parade_desc": "Everyone has their awkward phase. However, one member of the safehouse still hasn't left theirs, as evident from their Pear playlist. Not going to name any names, but a certain heister who has tattoos and enjoys surfing shouldn't be ruled out. Or maybe a certain former biker gang member has some guilty pleasures? It's anyone's guess."

	"bm_suit_var_general_purple": "The Purple General",

	"bm_suit_var_thug_chas_desc": "Dallas and Houston actually come from a long line of criminal family members. Some were more successful than others (let's just say there wasn't an open casket funeral) but somehow the two brothers' father lived long enough for the two of them to grow up to be part of one of the most powerful crime syndicates of all time. Papa Steele would be proud... probably."

	"bm_suit_var_gunslinger_train": "The Blue Gunman",
	"bm_suit_var_gunslinger_train_desc": "Is rivals with the Red Gunman. They seem to be 100% equally matched.

	"bm_gloves_redstripe_green": "Green Burnout Champ",
	"bm_gloves_redstripe_green_desc": "Given how many times the escape van's ran a stoplight, it's a miracle there hasn't been any collisions yet. The collision itself isn't even the scary part, it'd be the reprimanding from Bain."

	"bm_gloves_redstripe_gold": "Gold Burnout Champ",
	"bm_gloves_redstripe_gold_desc": "It's always scary when the gang brings back a particularly large haul. There's been many close calls with the van almost tipping over from all the gold in the back seat."

	"bm_gloves_redstripe_white_desc": "Dragan may be built like a tank, but unfortunately, his Achilles' heel is car sickness. No amount of weight lifting can solve that. Wick thinks it's funny and likes to make fake dry-heaving sounds in the escape van. Dragan thinks he'll beat the crap out of Wick as soon as they step out, but their friendship is too strong to let that thought linger."

	"bm_gloves_saintsleather_green": "Natural Green",
	"bm_gloves_saintsleather_green_desc": "All-natural, apparently. There's nothing wrong with the gloves themselves, but Duke is hung up on the question of where in the world the tailor found green leather."

	"bm_gloves_saintsleather_yellow": "Well-worn Yellow",

	"bm_gloves_saintsleather_blue": "Chrome-tanned Blue",
	"bm_gloves_saintsleather_blue_desc": "This stuff is flimsy, but it'll last you a heist. Even if they tear during the heist, the feds already have a good chunk of the crew's fingerprints anyway, thanks to the handful who decided to wear fingerless gloves."

	"bm_suit_var_thug_orngblack_desc": "Like moth to flame, Monarch Butterflies tend to flock to places with more money, perfect targets to steal from.\n\ \n\Actually, that's not true at all. Wick just told Dragan that to see how long he'd believe it. So far, so good."

	"bm_suit_var_lonorwa_sky_desc": "The amount of ice on the safehouse pavement is almost surreal. Jacket slipped and hit his head so hard that Duke swears he heard Jacket mumble a few words in a concussed rambling. He's been back to the tape recorder as usual since the incident."

	"bm_suit_var_lonorwa_dark": "Dead of Winter Evening",
	"bm_suit_var_lonorwa_dark_desc": "The best and worst time for a sneaky heist. Sure, there's no guards outside because no one wants to stand around in below zero temperatures, but no one wants to lug loot bags around in that weather either."

	"bm_suit_var_tesuit_bw": "Negative Invert",

	"bm_suit_var_tesuit_tan_desc": "Out of all the basic suit colors like black, grey, or blue, tan is probably one of the more adventurous choices while still keeping things professional. Not a bad compromise."

	"bm_suit_var_tesuit_brightblue": "Sky Blue",
	"bm_suit_var_tesuit_brightblue_desc": "Remember: the sky's the limit. The PAYDAY gang may have hit the Golden Grin, the Benevolent, Henry's Rock, and even the White House, but maybe that's not all. The world had better hope that no one finds gold on the moon."

	"bm_suit_var_miami_darkline": "Evening Breeze",
	"bm_suit_var_miami_darkline_desc": "On those calm, moonlit nights, it's hard to resist the urge to lie down in the grass and enjoy the peace. However, it's much harder to resist the urge to unscrew that silencer and show GenSec who's boss. Maybe silence is overrated."

	"bm_suit_var_miami_hotpink": "Scorching Pink",

	"bm_suit_var_bunny_purple": "Pajama Purple",
	"bm_suit_var_bunny_purple_desc": "This outfit keeps you so warm that it rivals the winter parka on Boiling Point. Of course, you run the risk of heat exhaustion on any heist above 0 degrees outside, but it's worth the trade-off."

	"bm_suit_var_bunny_green": "Meadow Green",
	"bm_suit_var_bunny_green_desc": "The only reason no one's found a jackalope is because everyone is looking in the wrong places. They don't live in forests or grassy meadows.\n\ \n\They're actually aquatic."
