Pack Description
A 2k re-texture of the "pear" computers and it's screen.
Also changed the hacking message text so it is clearer.
The Pear computer is most commonly seen in Big Bank.

Updates
An older version was included in my SuperPack so be sure to delete / override that if you use it.

Notes
I am now using lzma2 compression in .7z files.

How to Install
Please use 7-zip or WinRAR to open the .7z file and place the folders in
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\PAYDAY 2\assets\mod_overrides"
